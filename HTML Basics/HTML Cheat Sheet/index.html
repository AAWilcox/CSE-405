			The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test 
			that progressively gets <strong>more difficult as it continues</strong>. The 20 
			meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. 
			The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after 
			you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every 
			time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and 
			run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap 
			before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word 
			start. On your mark. <em>Get ready!â€¦ Start.</em>

			'Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise? I thought not. 
			It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. <a href="http://starwars.fandom.com
			/wiki/Sith/Legends" target="_blank">It's a Sith legend.</a> Darth Plagueis 
			was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to 
			influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark 
			side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of 
			the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so 
			powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, 
			of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then 
			his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, 
			but not himself.' - Sheev Palpatine
