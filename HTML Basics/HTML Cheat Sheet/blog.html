			<h3>Blog Post One</h3>
			<small>Posted by Alyssa on April 6</small>
			<p>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you 
			little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class 
			in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids 
			on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in 
			gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. 
			You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck 
			out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this 
			Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that 
			shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am 
			contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being 
			traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that 
			wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, 
			kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, 
			and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed 
			combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps 
			and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of 
			the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution 
			your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have 
			held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the 
			price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. 
			You're fucking dead, kiddo.</p>

			<h3>Blog Post Three</h3>
			<small>Posted by Decy on April 6</small>
			<p>I had a dream that I was trying to find a fruit scale in Walmart to weigh
			my pomegranates and then Obama stopped me, took them out of my hand, and told
			me the exact weight. I asked how he knew and he said "When the weight of the 
			world is on your shoulders, you learn."</p>
